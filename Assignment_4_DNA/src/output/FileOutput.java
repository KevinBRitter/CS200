 * The project using this file output class is a bioinformatics project   *
 * in Java.  It is intended to teach the programmer string manipulation   *
 * methods and by extension something about genetic research              *
 * in the computer age.                                                   *
 *                                                                        *

 * This program is the sole work and toil of Kevin Ritter (c) 2019        *
 * While it does implement commonly used algorithms, the final            *
 * application of these algorithms is novel to this work.                 *
